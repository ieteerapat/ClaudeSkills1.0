# Claude Code MCP Optimizer

A lean skills package for Claude Code focused on **Figma MCP accuracy** and **token efficiency**. Validated against the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

## Philosophy

Per [agentskills.io best practices](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/best-practices.md):
- Skills should add what the agent **wouldn't know without them**
- Rules the agent already follows (be terse, use diffs) belong in CLAUDE.md, not skills
- Skills should be **procedural workflows**, not declarative style guides

This package keeps only skills that pass the test: "Would the agent get this wrong without the skill?"

## Skills (3 — validated against agentskills.io)

| Skill | Version | Why It Passes | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `figma-accuracy` | 1.2.0 | Agent gets Figma implementation wrong 65-80% of the time without structured workflow | Enforces correct tool sequence, handles large designs, validates against screenshots, uses Code Connect, Code to Canvas |
| `session-memory` | 1.0.0 | Agent has no built-in way to persist state across compactions | Saves/restores work state to files so you never re-discover the same codebase |
| `hyperframes-video` | 2.0.0 | Agent gets HyperFrames composition rules wrong (clip markers, paused timelines, registration) without them | Self-contained: create deterministic MP4 videos from HTML/CSS + GSAP. All authoring rules embedded, no plugin required. Reference files for animation, CLI, and pipeline |

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

### What Was Removed (and why)

| Removed Skill | Reason | Where It Went |
|---|---|---|
| `token-saver` | Response style rules — agent follows these from CLAUDE.md | Absorbed into CLAUDE.md |
| `output-filter` | Same — formatting rules, not a procedure | Absorbed into CLAUDE.md |
| `model-routing` | Declarative info agent already knows. Claude Code has /fast built-in | Absorbed into CLAUDE.md |
| `mcp-token-optimizer` | Overlapped with figma-accuracy. General MCP rules are in CLAUDE.md | Split between CLAUDE.md and figma-accuracy |
| `figma-design-to-code` | Fully overlapped with figma-accuracy which is more thorough | Merged into figma-accuracy |

## Installation

### For Claude Code

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ieteerapat/ClaudeSkills1.0.git

# Copy into your project
cp -r ClaudeSkills1.0/.claude/ /path/to/your/project/
cp ClaudeSkills1.0/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/
```

### Global (all projects)

```bash
cp -r ClaudeSkills1.0/.claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Figma MCP Setup (Quick Start)

```bash
# 1. Install official Figma plugin (includes MCP server + skills)
claude plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official

# 2. Set token limit for large designs
export MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=100000

# 3. Generate project-specific rules (one-time)
# In Claude Code, prompt: "create design system rules for my project"
```

## Companion Tools

| Tool | What It Does | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) | Compresses bash output 60-90% | **`sh installers/install-rtk.sh`** (see [installers/](./installers/)) |
| [Context Mode](https://github.com/mksglu/context-mode) | Sandboxes MCP output, 98% reduction | `/plugin marketplace add mksglu/context-mode` |
| [CodeGraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) | Knowledge graph, 92% fewer tool calls | `npx @colbymchenry/codegraph` |
| [Claude-Mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) | Persistent memory across sessions | `npx claude-mem install` |
| [Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) | Extreme output compression 75% | `curl -fsSL .../install.sh \| bash` |

## Validated External Skills (install separately)

These skills pass the agentskills.io test ("would the agent get this wrong without it?") and complement this package:

| Skill | Source | Install | Why It Helps |
|---|---|---|---|
| Figma Official Plugin | Anthropic marketplace | `claude plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official` | Includes figma-implement-design, figma-use, figma-code-connect, figma-create-design-system-rules |
| skill-creator | anthropics/skills (67K ⭐) | `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills` | Create and evaluate your own skills with structured evals |
| Figma MCP Server Guide | figma/mcp-server-guide | `npx skills add https://github.com/figma/mcp-server-guide --skill figma-implement-design` | Official pixel-perfect implementation workflow |

## Skills That FAILED Validation (don't install)

Evaluated against agentskills.io criteria — these don't add value over CLAUDE.md rules:

| Skill | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| Most "terse output" skills | Agent follows these from CLAUDE.md — not procedural |
| Most "code review" skills | Declarative checklists — agent already knows good practices |
| Most "commit message" skills | Simple formatting — one line in CLAUDE.md is enough |
| Most "SOLID principles" skills | Agent already knows SOLID — this is general knowledge |
| Generic "best practices" skills | Vague declarations, not procedures with domain expertise |

## Validation

Skills in this package follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification.md):
- `name`: lowercase, hyphens only, matches folder name
- `description`: describes what + when to use
- Body: procedural instructions, not declarative rules
- Under 500 lines, references/ for detailed content
- Evaluated per [agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills.md)
